# kigen
General implementation of diagram semigroups based on partitioned binary relations.

Goals:

1. To serve as a recomputation tool for existing diagram semigroup packages, e.g. Semigroups of GAP.
2. To be minimalistic by implementing only the most general diagram representation, the partitioned binary relations. Proritising correctness checking over efficiency.
3. Have fun with another programming language, Scala.
